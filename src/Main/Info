Application has many defects and further development should be made.

By now the are no validator for user input, exceptions unhandled.
For command only whole integers are accepted.
For purchase costs only values with "." as decimal delimiter are accepted.

Also transaction resolving algorithm is sensitive to input as number rounding is pretty rough.
Case when sum of overpaid and sum of underpaid amounts might not be equal can occur.
Application does't handle that case.
